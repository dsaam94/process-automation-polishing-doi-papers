DomainNet:
 Homograph Detection for Data Lake Disambiguation
by Aristotelis Leventidis, 
 Laura Di Rocco, Wolfgang Gatterbauer, Ren√©e J. Miller and Mirek Riedewald

 DomainNet, a system that disambiguates values from heterogeneous datasets by creating a network representing co-occurring values and computing their graph centrality. The system is unsupervised, its accuracy outperforms the state-of-the-art, and it is accompanied
 by an open benchmark. The paper is of high significance: the problem is important, the proposed solution is effective, and the benchmark facilitates further research.
